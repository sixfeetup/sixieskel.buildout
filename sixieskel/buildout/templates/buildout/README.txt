=======================
Using a custom buildout
=======================
 
First step, you will need to copy the ``buildout.cfg_tmpl`` into the
buildout root, and then select the profile you want to run::

 $ cp profiles/buildout.cfg.tmpl buildout.cfg
 $ vi buildout.cfg

Then you need to run::

 $ python bootstrap.py
 
This will install zc.buildout for you. 

To create an instance immediately, run::

 $ bin/buildout
 
This will download Plone's eggs and products for you, as well as other 
dependencies, create a new Zope 2 installation, and create a new Zope instance
configured with these products.

You can start your Zope instance by running::

 $ bin/instance start
 
or, to run in foreground mode::

 $ bin/instance fg
 
To run unit tests, you can use::

 $ bin/instance test -s my.package
 
Installing PIL
--------------

The buildout will install PIL for you (via the Pillow egg)

Using a different Python installation
--------------------------------------

Buildout will use your system Python installation by default. However, Zope
2.10 (and by extension, Plone) will only work with Python 2.4. You can verify
which version of Python you have, by running::

 $ python -V
 
If that is not a 2.4 version, you need to install Python 2.4 from 
http://python.org. If you wish to keep another version as your main system
Python, edit buildout.cfg and add an 'executable' option to the "[buildout]"
section, pointing to a python interpreter binary::

 [buildout]
 ...
 executable = /path/to/python
 
Working with buildout.cfg
-------------------------

You can change any option in buildout.cfg and re-run bin/buildout to reflect
the changes. This may delete things inside the 'parts' directory, but should
keep your Data.fs and source files intact. 

To save time, you can run buildout in "offline" (-o) and non-updating (-N) 
mode, which will prevent it from downloading things and checking for new 
versions online::

 $ bin/buildout -Nov

Extending buildout configs
--------------------------

This buildout makes use of the 'extends' functionality of buildout.  The
buildout.cfg contains only minimal information.  Here are what the rest of the
configs are for.

buildout.cfg.tmpl
  This is a template to be used for the buildout.cfg at the root of the
  site. See the file for more details.

base.cfg
  The base config contains all of the configuration for the basis of the site.
  Typical sections include zope2, instance, zeoserver and plone.  In this
  config we include all the eggs and products that will be used in all of the
  extended configs.

local.cfg
  The local config sets up our local development environment for us.  It
  includes all the debugging packages that are typically used during
  development.  It extends base.cfg and debug.cfg

debug.cfg
  The debug config contains all of our debugging products and packages. One
  package to make note of is PDBDebugMode.  It will open up a pdb prompt
  anytime there is an error.  This will cause the page to hang until you tell
  pdb to (c)ontinue.
  
  The debug config also contains a way to 'refresh' your product in
  plone.reload.  You can access it like this::
  
    http://<zope_host>:<zope_port>/@@reload
  
  And also a way of recording doctests::
  
    http://<zope_host>:<zope_port>/++resource++recorder/index.html
  
  Take a look at the config to see what other tools are available.

release.cfg
  The release config is the base config for doing releases.  It contains the
  specific versions of eggs that are needed to make the site run properly.  It
  also contains some configuration that is common for each release stage.

versions.cfg
  This contains the pinned versions of packages for use when release to production

testing.cfg
  The dev config merely sets up the proper port and ip-address for the dev
  site to run on.

staging.cfg
  The maint config merely sets up the proper port and ip-address for the maint
  site to run on.

prod.cfg
  The prod config is similar to the dev and maint configs in that it sets up
  the proper ip-address and port numbers.  But it can also be used to set up a
  Zope cluster, tune the number of threads being used, bump up zeo cache
  sizes, set up pound, squid, nginx, etc.  This will be the config used to run
  the site in production mode.

Creating new eggs
-----------------

New packages you are working on (but which are not yet released as eggs and
uploaded to the Python Package Index, aka PYPI) should be placed in src. You can do::

 $ cd src/
 $ paster create -t plone my.package
 
Use "paster create --list-templates" to see all available templates. Answer
the questions and you will get a new egg. Then tell buildout about your egg
by editing buildout.cfg and adding your source directory to 'develop'::

 [buildout]
 ...
 develop =
    src/my.package
    
You can list multiple packages here, separated by whitespace or indented
newlines.

You probably also want the Zope instance to know about the package. Add its
package name to the list of eggs in the ``[instance]`` section, or under the
main ``[buildout]`` section::

 [instance]
 ...
 eggs =
    my.package

If you also require a ZCML slug for your package, buildout can create one
automatically. Just add the package to the 'zcml' option::

 [instance]
 ...
 zcml =
    my.package
    
When you are finished, re-run buildout. Offline, non-updating mode should 
suffice::

 $ bin/buildout -Nov
 
Developing old-style products
-----------------------------

If you are developing old-style Zope 2 products (not eggs) then you can do so
by placing the product code in the top-level 'products' directory. This is
analogous to the ``Products/`` directory inside a normal Zope 2 instance and is
scanned on start-up for new products.  The products folder is populated using
svn:externals on the directory.  See the products/EXTERNALS.txt for more info.

These products are only available in the profiles/local.cfg::

 [instance]
 ...
 products =
     ${buildout:directory}/products

To release your old style products you'll need to tag them and then enable the
``[products-release]`` part in the profiles/release.cfg::

 release-parts = 
     products-release
     ${buildout:base-parts}

 [products-release]
 recipe = plone.recipe.distros
 urls = 
    https://dist.sixfeetup.com/private/my-project/MyProduct.tgz

 [instance]
 ...
 products = 
     ${instance:base-products}
     ${products-release:location}

Depending on a new egg
----------------------

If you want to use a new egg that is in the Python Package Index, all you need
to do is to add it to the "eggs" option under the main ``[buildout]`` section::

 [buildout]
 ...
 eggs =
    my.package
    
If it's listed somewhere else than the Python Package Index, you can add a link
telling buildout where to find it in the 'find-links' option::

 [buildout]
 ...
 find-links =
    http://dist.plone.org
    http://download.zope.org/distribution/
    http://effbot.org/downloads
    http://some.host.com/packages
    
Using existing old-style products
---------------------------------

If you are using an old-style (non-egg) product, you can either add it as an 
automatically downloaded archive or put it in the top-level "products" folder.
The former is probably better, because it means you can redistribute your
buildout.cfg more easily::

 [third-party]
 recipe = plone.recipe.distros
 urls =
    http://plone.org/products/someproduct/releases/1.3/someproduct-1.3.tar.gz

If someproduct-1.3.tar.gz extracts into several products inside a top-level
directory, e.g. SomeProduct-1.3/PartOne and SomeProduct-1.3/PartTwo, then
add it as a "nested package"::

 [third-party]
 recipe = plone.recipe.distros
 urls =
    http://plone.org/products/someproduct/releases/1.3/someproduct-1.3.tar.gz
 nested-packages =
    someproduct-1.3.tar.gz
 
Alternatively, if it extracts to a directory which contains the version 
number, add it as a "version suffix package"::

 [third-party]
 recipe = plone.recipe.distros
 urls =
    http://plone.org/products/someproduct/releases/1.3/someproduct-1.3.tar.gz
 version-suffix-packages = 
    someproduct-1.3.tar.gz

 [buildout]
 ...
 parts =
    plone
    zope2
    third-party
    instance

Note that "third-party" comes before the "instance" part::

 [myproduct]
 recipe = plone.recipe.bundlecheckout
 url = http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/myproduct/trunk
 
Finally, you need to tell Zope to find this new checkout and add it to its
list of directories that are scanned for products::

 [instance]
 ...
 products =
    ${buildout:directory}/products
    ${third-party:location}
    
Without this last step, the "myproduct" part is simply managing an svn 
checkout and could potentially be used for something else instead.



=============
Using Windows
=============

To use buildout on Windows, you will need to install a few dependencies which
other platforms manage on their own.

You can use an installer version of all the steps below from this link:

http://release.ingeniweb.com/third-party-dist/python2.4.4-win32.zip

Or follow these steps manually (thanks to Hanno Schlichting for these):

Python
------

(http://python.org)

- Download and install Python 2.4.4 using the Windows installer from
  http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/python-2.4.4.msi
  Select 'Install for all users' and it will put Python into the
  "C:\Python24" folder by default.

- You also want the pywin32 extensions available from
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pywin32/pywin32-210.win32-py2.4.exe?modtime=1159009237&big_mirror=0

- And as a last step you want to download the Python imaging library available
  from http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.6.win32-py2.4.exe

- If you develop Zope based applications you will usually only need Python 2.4
  at the moment, so it's easiest to put the Python binary on the systems PATH,
  so you don't need to specify its location manually each time you call it.

  Thus, put "C:\Python24" and "C:\Python24\Scripts" onto the PATH. You can
  find the PATH definition in the control panel under system preferences on
  the advanced tab at the bottom. The button is called environment variables.
  You want to add it at the end of the already existing PATH in the system
  section. Paths are separated by a semicolons.

- You can test if this was successful by opening a new shell (cmd) and type
  in 'python -V'. It should report version 2.4.4 (or whichever version you
  installed).
  
  Opening a new shell can be done quickly by using the key combination
  'Windows-r' or if you are using Parallels on a Mac 'Apple-r'. Type in 'cmd'
  into the popup box that opens up and hit enter.

Installing PIL
--------------

To use Plone, you need PIL, the Python Imaging Library. If you don't already
have this, download and install it from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil.

Subversion
----------

(http://subversion.tigris.org)

- Download the nice installer from
  http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/35379/svn-1.4.2-setup.exe

- Run the installer. It defaults to installing into
  "C:\Program Files\Subversion".

- Now put the install locations bin subfolder (for example
  "C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin") on your system PATH in the same way you
  put Python on it.

- Open a new shell again and type in: 'svn --version' it should report
  version 1.4.2 or newer.


MinGW
-----

(http://www.mingw.org/)

This is a native port of the gcc compiler and its dependencies for Windows.
There are other approaches enabling you to compile Python C extensions on
Windows including Cygwin and using the official Microsoft C compiler, but this
is a lightweight approach that uses only freely available tools. As
it's used by a lot of people chances are high it will work for you and there's
plenty of documentation out there to help you in troubleshooting problems.

- Download the MinGW installer from
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.3.exe?modtime=1168794334&big_mirror=1

- The installer will ask you which options you would like to install. Choose
  base and make here. It will install into "C:\MinGW" by default. The install
  might take some time as it's getting files from sourceforge.net and you
  might need to hit 'retry' a couple of times.

- Now put the install location's bin subfolder (for example "C:\MinGW\bin") on
  your system PATH in the same way you put Python on it.

- Test this again by typing in: 'gcc --version' on a newly opened shell and
  it should report version 3.4.2 or newer.


Configure Distutils to use MinGW
--------------------------------

Some general information are available from
http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/Python%20extensions for example but
you don't need to read them all.

- Create a file called 'distutils.cfg' in "C:\Python24\Lib\distutils". Open it
  with a text editor ('notepad distutils.cfg') and fill in the following lines:

  [build]
  compiler=mingw32

  This will tell distutils to use MinGW as the default compiler, so you don't
  need to specify it manually using "--compiler=mingw32" while calling a
  package's setup.py with a command that involves building C extensions. This
  is extremely useful if the build command is written down in a buildout
  recipe where you cannot change the options without hacking the recipe
  itself. The z2c.recipe.zope2install used in ploneout is one such example.
